		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<p>I think of myself as a fairly well-rounded person. I am decently good at writing, playing instruments, learning new languages, both spoken and programming, and drawing. I am also decently good at math.</p>
		<p>Insofar as programming languages, I know HTML/CSS, Python, Javascript and C. I am also proficient at using digital tools such as Medibang Paint Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint, as well as their Google equivalents: Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides.</p>
		<p>A more thorough assessment of my skills can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-khoury-b125491bb/">LinkedIn.</a></p>
		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
		<p>So far I have completed 3 personal projects, this website, a small python program that acts as an additional tool for the video game osu! which allows one to export their play data (available on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home">the osu website</a>) to a spreadsheet, and a custom theme (customized CSS) for BetterDiscord, which is a customizable Discord client. All 3 projects are available via my github.</p>
